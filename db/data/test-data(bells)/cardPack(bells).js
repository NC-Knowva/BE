                "A1": "Social support can help individuals resist pressures to conform or obey. If they have support from a dissenter (someone who disagrees with the majority or refuses to obey), it frees the individual from the pressure to conform or obey, allowing them to act independently. This was demonstrated in the Asch study investigating the unanimity of the majority, and in Milgram’s variation where a disobedient confederate refused to obey at a certain point."

                "A2": "Allen and Levine (1971) found that introducing a dissenter in an Asch-style study greatly reduced conformity levels, even if the dissenter wore thick glasses and claimed they had poor eyesight. This supports the idea that having social support increases resistance to social influence."
