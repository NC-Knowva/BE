        {
            Q1: "Describe the role of social support in resistance to social influence.",
            A1: "Social support can help individuals resist pressures to conform or obey. If they have support from a dissenter (someone who disagrees with the majority or refuses to obey), it frees the individual from the pressure to conform or obey, allowing them to act independently. This was demonstrated in the Asch study investigating the unanimity of the majority, and in Milgram’s variation where a disobedient confederate refused to obey at a certain point.",
            Q2: "What did Allen and Levine (1971) find about the role of dissenters in conformity?",
            A2: "Allen and Levine (1971) found that introducing a dissenter in an Asch-style study greatly reduced conformity levels, even if the dissenter wore thick glasses and claimed they had poor eyesight. This supports the idea that having social support increases resistance to social influence.",
            Q3: "Define the concept of 'Minority Influence'.",
            A3: "Minority influence is when a small group (or individual) influences the behaviour and beliefs of a larger group of people. This usually has a smaller effect than conformity to a majority, but an effect is possible."
